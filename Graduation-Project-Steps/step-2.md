<br><br>

## 1- System Design:

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

### Description:
- Designing the overall architecture of the system, including both software and AI components. This defines how the components will interact and integrate.

### Steps:
- Architectural Design: Design the system architecture, including components, data flow, and integration points.
- Detailed Design: Create detailed designs for each component, including algorithms and data structures.
- Design Documentation: Document the design specifications and diagrams.
- Review Design: Get feedback from peers or mentors to refine the design.

### Skills/Tools:
- System design and architecture, Diagramming skills
- Design tools (e.g., UML, Lucidchart, Microsoft Visio)

</details>

## 2- Design Methodology:

<summary>Details</summary>

### Description:
- Building preliminary versions of the software or AI components to test concepts and gather feedback. Prototypes help in refining designs before full-scale development.

### Steps:
- Develop Prototype: Create a basic version of the system or component with core functionality.
- Test Prototype: Conduct testing to evaluate the prototypeâ€™s performance and usability.
- Gather Feedback: Collect feedback from stakeholders or users.
- Refine Prototype: Make improvements based on feedback and test results.

### Skills/Tools:
- Prototyping techniques, Usability testing
- Prototyping tools (e.g., Figma, InVision, Python)
